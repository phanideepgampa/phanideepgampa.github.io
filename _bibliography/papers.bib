      abstract = {We consider the finite horizon continuous reinforcement learning problem. Our contribution is three-fold.
First,we give a tractable algorithm based on optimistic value iteration for the problem.
Next,we give a lower bound on regret of order $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ for any algorithm that discretizes the state space,
improving the previous regret bound of $\Omega(T^{1/2})$ of Ortner and Ryabko \cite{contrl} for the same problem. Next,under the assumption that the rewards and transitions are H\"{o}lder Continuous 
we show that the upper bound on the discretization error is $const.Ln^{-\alpha}T$. 
Finally,we give some simple experiments to validate our propositions.

      abstract = {We propose an extensible deep learning method that uses reinforcement learning to train neural networks for offline ranking in information retrieval (IR). We call our method BanditRank as it treats ranking as a contextual bandit problem. In the domain of learning to rank for IR, current deep learning models are trained on objective functions different from the measures they are evaluated on. Since most evaluation measures are discrete quantities, they cannot be leveraged by directly using gradient descent algorithms without an approximation. BanditRank bridges this gap by directly optimizing a task-specific measure, such as mean average precision (MAP), using gradient descent. Specifically, a contextual bandit whose action is to rank input documents is trained using a policy gradient algorithm to directly maximize the reward. The reward can be a single measure, such as MAP, or a combination of several measures. The notion of ranking is also inherent in BanditRank, similar to the current \textit{listwise} approaches. To evaluate the effectiveness of BanditRank, we conducted a series of experiments on datasets related to three different tasks, i.e., web search, community, and factoid question answering. We found that it performs better than state-of-the-art methods when applied on the question answering datasets. On the web search dataset, we found that BanditRank performed better than four strong listwise baselines including LambdaMART, AdaRank, ListNet and Coordinate Ascent.},
